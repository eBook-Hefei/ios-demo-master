== DESCRIPTION:

Inspired by EGOTableViewPullRefresh[https://github.com/enormego/EGOTableViewPullRefresh], a similar control 
to the pull down to refresh control created by atebits in Tweetie 2, I implement this simple control to 
load more rows into the table.

== Usage:

Check the demo. Thanks for enormego. Most of the codes are directly copied from their demo.
